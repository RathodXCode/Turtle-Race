# Turtle-Race
This project simulates a turtle race using the Python `turtle` module. Two turtles, Tess (red) and Jeff (green), race across the screen, and the winner is displayed in a message box.

## Files
- `main.py`: The main script that sets up and starts the race.
- `functions.py`: Contains the functions used to set up the race and determine the winner.

## Setup
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install easygui_qt
    ```

## How to Run
1. Run the [main.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) script:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## Functions
